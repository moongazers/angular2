Have tried all kinds of ways to include Angular Material UI but always logged "unmet peer dependencies";<br />
looks like it's an existing issue: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/1941, <br />
so use custom css for now. <br />
~~Let me know if there is a workaround to solve it...~~<br />
The one with "Angular Material UI" is "USHolidayAppCLI" repo.  Check that one instead.



Requirement:  <br />
Build a 2-route Single Page Application using the following technologies and API. The homepage should display a list of all 2015 USA Holidays as links. When you click on any Holiday link it will change routes to a new view with the details about that Holiday. All information should come from the Holiday API and not be hard-coded.
 <br />
Use AngularJS 2 https://angular.io/ <br />
Use TypeScript<br />
Use Angular Material UI https://material.angular.io/ <br />
Consume USA Holidays API https://holidayapi.com/<br />
