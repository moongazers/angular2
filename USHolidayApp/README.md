Have tried all kinds of ways to include Angular Material UI but always logged "unmet peer dependencies";
looks like it's an existing issue: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/1941, 
so use custom css for now. 
Let me know if there is a workaround to solve it...



Requirement:  
Build a 2-route Single Page Application using the following technologies and API. The homepage should display a list of all 2015 USA Holidays as links. When you click on any Holiday link it will change routes to a new view with the details about that Holiday. All information should come from the Holiday API and not be hard-coded.
 
Use AngularJS 2 https://angular.io/ 
Use TypeScript
Use Angular Material UI https://material.angular.io/ 
Consume USA Holidays API https://holidayapi.com/
